                <h2>eagle</h2>
                <p>eagle, any of many large, heavy-beaked, big-footed birds of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae
                    (order Accipitriformes). In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo. An
                    eagle
                    may resemble a vulture in build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested)
                    head and strong feet equipped with great curved talons. A further difference is in foraging habits:
                    eagles subsist mainly on live prey. They are too ponderous for effective aerial pursuit but try to
                    surprise and overwhelm their prey on the ground. Like owls, many decapitate their kills. Because of
                    their strength, eagles have been a symbol of war and imperial power since Babylonian times. Their
                    likeness is found on Greek and Roman ruins, coins, and medals.</p>

                <h2>Typical pigeons</h2>
                <p>pigeon, any of several hundred species of birds constituting the family Columbidae (order
                    Columbiformes). Smaller forms are usually called doves, larger forms pigeons. An exception is the
                    white domestic pigeon, the symbol known as the “dove of peace.”

                    Pigeons occur worldwide except in the coldest regions and the most remote islands. About 250 species
                    are known; two-thirds of them occur in tropical Southeast Asia, Australia, and the islands of the
                    western Pacific, but the family also has many members in Africa and South America and a few in
                    temperate Eurasia and North America. All members of the family suck liquids, rather than sip and
                    swallow as do other birds, and all pigeon parents feed their young “pigeon’s milk,” the sloughed-off
                    lining of the crop, the production of which is stimulated by the hormone prolactin. The nestling
                    obtains this “milk” by poking its bill down the parent’s throat.</p>

                <h2>Parrots</h2>
                <p>Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as psittacines are birds with a strong curved beak, upright
                    stance, and clawed feet.They are classified in four families that contain roughly 410 species in 101
                    genera, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The four families are the Psittaculidae
                    (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuidae (cockatoos), and
                    Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction,
                    with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group.
                    Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions
                    as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South Americav and Australasia.</p>

                <h2>swallow</h2>
                <p>The swallows, martins, and saw-wings, or Hirundinidae are a family of passerine songbirds found
                    around the world on all continents, including occasionally in Antarctica. Highly adapted to aerial
                    feeding, they have a distinctive appearance. The term "swallow" is used as the common name for
                    Hirundo rustica in the UK and Ireland. Around 90 species of Hirundinidae are known, divided into 21
                    genera, with the greatest diversity found in Africa, which is also thought to be where they evolved
                    as hole-nesters.They also occur on a number of oceanic islands. A number of European and North
                    American species are long-distance migrants; by contrast, the West and South African swallows are
                    nonmigratory</p>

                <h2>Starling</h2>
                <p>Starlings belong to the family Sturnidae, common name of Sturnid,The Sturnidae are named for the
                    genus Sturnus, which in turn comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. The family contains
                    128 species which are divided into 36 genera. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are
                    called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent
                    plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the
                    islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these
                    areas, as well as North America, Hawaii, and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats
                    with native birds and are considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar to most
                    people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the
                    Pacific</p>

                <h2>Toucan</h2>
                <p>Toucans are arboreal and typically lay two to four white eggs in their nests. They make their nests
                    in tree hollows and holes excavated by other animals such as woodpeckers—the toucan bill has very
                    limited use as an excavation tool. When the eggs hatch, the young emerge completely naked, without
                    any down. Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or
                    small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists hypothesize they
                    do to establish dominance hierarchies. In Africa and Asia, hornbills occupy the toucans' ecological
                    niche, an example of convergent evolution.</p>
