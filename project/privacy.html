                <h6>We value the trust you place in us. That's why we insist upon the highest standards for secure
                    transactions and customer information privacy. Please read the following statement to learn about
                    our information gathering and dissemination practices.

                <h4>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and other Information</h4> <br>
                <h6>When you use our Website, we collect and store your personal information which is provided by you
                    from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and
                    customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your
                    needs, and to customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly,
                    while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving
                    this purpose. <br><br>

                    In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal
                    information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.
                    Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have
                    the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the
                    Website. We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our
                    Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and
                    behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and
                    analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from
                    (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our
                    Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. <br><br>

                    We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our
                    web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small
                    files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features
                    that are only available through the use of a "cookie". <br><br>

                    We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies
                    can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session
                    cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
                    You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may
                    not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password
                    more frequently during a session. <br><br>

                    Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website
                    that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. <br><br>

                    If you choose to buy on the Website, we collect information about your buying behaviour. <br><br>

                    If you transact with us, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit
                    / debit card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument
                    details and tracking information from cheques or money orders. <br><br>

                    If you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave
                    feedback, we will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this information as
                    necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by
                    law. <br><br>

                    If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third
                    parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such
                    information into a file specific to you. <br><br>

                    We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card /
                    debit card / other payment instrument details, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with
                    us. While you can browse some sections of our Website without being a registered member, certain
                    activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. We do use your contact information to
                    send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests. We may also contact you for
                    after-sale services, to understand how your experience with us was, which would help us to improve
                    ourself.</h6> <br>
                <h4>Use of Demographic / Profile Data / Your Information</h4><br>
                <h6> We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal
                    information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your
                    personal information to resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service;
                    collect money; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and
                    offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us
                    against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise
                    described to you at the time of collection. <br><br>

                    In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyse
                    demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our Website. <br><br>

                    We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our
                    Website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic
                    information. <br><br>

                    We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for
                    contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this
                    data to tailor your experience at our Website, providing you with content that we think you might be
                    interested in and to display content according to your preferences.</h6> <br>
